# Resonate-contacts

A simple responsive contacts app built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
The app fetches user data from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users),  
allowing you to browse, search, and view detailed contact information.

# How to run on local server

### 1. Install Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure you have **Node.js (v20.19.0 or higher)** and **npm (v10.0.0 or higher)** installed.  
Vite (v7.1.7) and all other dependencies will be automatically installed via:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start Development Server

Once the installation is complete, start the local dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the link shown in your terminal (usually):

```bash
http://localhost:5173/
```
